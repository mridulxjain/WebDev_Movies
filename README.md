# Movie Database (Repo Sprint Starter)

This is a lightweight Next.js starter for the Repo Sprint event.

Notes for participants:
- The UI renders placeholder cards on the home page to help you focus on layout first.
- API calls have been intentionally removed from the grid/cards. See TODO comments in files for integration spots.
- Check `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to participate and submit your work.

Happy hacking! 🚀
